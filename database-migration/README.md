This lib provides functions and data structures for database migration tools. The implemented
functionality is database agnostic and agnostic to the way migration definitions are stored.

This crate is currently part of the [SurrealDB-Migrate] project. It is developed for the needs of
this project but could be used by other database migration projects as well.
